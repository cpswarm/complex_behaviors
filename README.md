# CPSwarm Complex Behaviors Library
The CPSwarm Complex Behaviors Library contains the swarm behaviors for the cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that are required to perform the use cases of the CPSwarm project. Thanks to the modular design of the CPS behaviors, new swarm behaviors can be added easily. A behavior is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS). It mainly consists of the state machines that perform complex missions using several simpler swarm algorithms from the CPSwarm Swarm Behaviors Library. Additionally, it contains ROS launch files and configuration files that allow to perform real world missions as well as simulations.

## Getting Started
The CPSwarm behavior library is based on the latest ROS long-term support release [ROS Kinetic Kame](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/). Newer versions may also work.

For usage instructions, please refer to the individual ROS packages in this repository.

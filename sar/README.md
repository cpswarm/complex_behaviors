# sar

This package performs search and rescue (SAR) with a heterogeneous swarm of cyber physical systems (CPSs), i.e., unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs). It is part of the complex behaviors library.

## Overview
To perform SAR, a swarm of UAVs covers an area. Once a target is found, it is tracked by the UAVs and the UGVs are informed. The most suitable UGV is selected to rescue the target by moving to its position. Once the target is rescued, the tracking UAVs continue coverage while the rescuing UGV returns home.

SAR is a complex behavior that is implemented by finite state machines (FSMs). Each state represents a behavior and transitions are triggered by events. This package contains the FSMs, the definition of events exchanged between CPSs, and launch files that allow to start simulations and perform real world missions.
